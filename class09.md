## JavaScript

### Events

Your browser records various kinds of events as you navigate the site. This is how the browser expresses itself, But, in terms of the event, it's about what you do on the web, what data you gather, and where you'll show it to the user, and in what form.

What does JavaScript have to offer? User feedback and actions can be handled and verified using event handlers.

An HTML event may be initiated by the browser or initiated by the user.

Here are some HTML event examples: [001](#001)

- The loading of an HTML web page is complete.
- A HTML input field has been modified.
- The HTML button was pressed.
- When events occur, you may feel compelled to act.

When events are found, JavaScript allows you to run code.
