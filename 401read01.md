# The Python Environment

## The Interpreter

Let’s get started with the most important thing when working with python: the interpreter. 
For sure you could just simply download and install your favorite version of python and put everything into that.
But what if you have programs that require different python versions or programs that depend on different versions 
of the same third-party module and you want to switch between those programs seamlessly?
Pyenv will help you doing that!
Pyenv is a set of three tools, from which I present two here, that are pyenv (used to install python) and pyenv-virtualenv
(used to configure your global tools). You can install them by
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
After that, add the following lines to your .bashrc (same for .zshrc) to have pyenv available in your terminal
export PATH="~/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
and finally, restart your terminal. Now, you can use pyenv to install almost any python interpreter, including pypy,
and anaconda. Note, that pyenv builds python locally on your machine. Building python requires several libraries.
On my Ubuntu machine, I have to install the following ones to not run into problems
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 bzip2 libbz2-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev openssl 
libgdbm-dev libgdbm-compat-dev liblzma-dev libreadline-dev libncursesw5-dev libffi-dev uuid-dev
Now, to install a python interpreter just do
pyenv install VERSION_YOU_WOULD_LIKE_TO_INSTALL
You can list out all versions available via pyenv
pyenv install --list
To make it concrete, let’s install python 3.7.5 and make it your default global-interpreter
pyenv install 3.7.5
pyenv global 3.7.5
When you type python — version you should get back Python 3.7.5
Dependency Management
Managing project dependencies in python can become messy or manual. There exists a bunch of tools to help you with that.
The one that I use the most is poetry.
Apart from many other things, poetry helps you to easily
manage your projects’ dependencies,
separate your projects through virtual environments,
build both applications as well as libraries without headaches.
The way the authors recommend installing poetry is
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
Another way, that I am going to show you is using pip and pyenv-virtualenv. You may ask: Why not just pip? Because this would install poetry and its dependencies in your global environment, which you probably don’t need there and also don’t want there. So, here are the necessary commands
### Create a virtual environment called tools that is based on 3.7.5
pyenv virtualenv 3.7.5 tools 
### Install poetry into the tools virtual env
pyenv activate tools
pip install poetry 
### Check installed poetry version
poetry --version
### Leave the virtual env 
pyenv deactivate 
### This does not work yet 
poetry --version
### Add your tools virtual env to the globally available ones
pyenv global 3.7.5 tools
### Now this works and you can start using poetry
poetry --version
Before we start using poetry to create our first project I recommend configuring it, such that it creates your project’s virtual environment in a .venv folder inside the project directory. This is very handy when you are using IDEs like VS Code or PyCharm as they immediately recognize that and pick up the correct interpreter
### That seems to be peotry prior to 1.0.0
poetry config settings.virtualenvs.in-project true
### That is poetry since 1.0.0
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
Note that, you only have to set this configuration once, as its set globally and persisted.
Finally, we have everything in place to create our first project using poetry, Awesome! I call this project dsexample, a stupid name I know but I did not want to waste even more time finding a better one. To show you how to use poetry, I add pandas in a specific version and fastapi with all extra requirements
### Initialze a new project
poetry new dsexample 
cd dsexample
### Add modules and create virtual environment.
poetry add pandas=0.25 fastapi --extras all
### As an example of how you could add a git module
poetry add tf2-utils --git git@github.com:Shawe82/tf2-utils.git
