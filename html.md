Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

2- Prepare your research for reference.

The main parts of our element are as follows:

1-0The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

2- The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends.
3-  Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.

4-  The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.

5- The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
