# Read: 14a - CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations


With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. 
Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. 
All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

The transform property comes in two different settings, t
wo-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

Within this lesson we’ll take a look at both two-dimensional and three-dimensional transforms.
Generally speaking, browser support for the transform property isn’t great, 
but it is getting better every day. For the best support vendor prefixes are encouraged, 
however you may need to download the nightly version of Chrome to see all of these transforms in action.

## Transitions & Animations


One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations.
Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS,
without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, 
such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes.
Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

ike most 25-year-olds, Julia Rozovsky wasn’t sure what she wanted to do with her life. 
She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasn’t a good match. Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, 
which was interesting but lonely. Maybe a big corporation would be a better fit. 
Or perhaps a fast-growing start-up. All she knew for certain was that she wanted to find a job that was more social. 
‘‘I wanted to be part of a community, part of something people were building together,’’ 
she told me. She thought about various opportunities — Internet companies, a Ph.D.
program — but nothing seemed exactly right. So in 2009, 
she chose the path that allowed her to put off making a decision: She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management.

When Rozovsky arrived on campus, she was assigned to a study group carefully engineered by the school to foster tight bonds. Study groups have become a rite of passage at M.B.A. programs, a way for students to practice working in teams and a reflection of the increasing demand for employees who can adroitly navigate group dynamics. A worker today might start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand, then jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, while also juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee. To prepare students for that complex world, business schools around the country have revised their curriculums to emphasize team-focused learning.

Every day, between classes or after dinner, Rozovsky and her four teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments, compare spreadsheets and strategize for exams. Everyone was smart and curious, and they had a lot in common: They had gone to similar colleges and had worked at analogous firms. These shared experiences, Rozovsky hoped, would make it easy for them to work well together. But it didn’t turn out that way. ‘‘There are lots of people who say some of their best business-school friends come from their study groups,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘It wasn’t like that for me.’’
