# From the Duckett HTML book:
## Summary LINKS

 Links are created using the <a> element.
* The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate 
the page you are linking to.
* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is 
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
* You can create links to open email programs with an 
email address in the "to" field.
* You can use the id attribute to target elements within 
a page that can be linked to.
  
 ## Summary INTRODUCING CSS
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that 
element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the 
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that 
indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your 
rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial 
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, 
although they may appear within an HTML page.
  
  ## Summary COLOR
* Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps 
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: 
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast 
between any text and the background color (otherwise 
people will not be able to read your content).
* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to 
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, 
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA
