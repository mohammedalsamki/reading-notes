# In Tests We Trust â€” TDD with Python Ana Paula Gomes Ana Paula Gomes






This post is based on a talk that I did during Python Nordeste 2017. I hope you enjoy! Please donâ€™t forget to give me some feedback.
So, you wanna do some tests, right?
Some time ago, when I was beginning my career as a programmer, 
I heard other programmers talking about two things: refactoring and unit tests. To be honest, 
they just talk about refactoring to explain why this practice should be avoided (and how scared they were to do it) 
and about unit tests to say they are too expensive to begin with, that they spend a lot of time, etc. Unit tests did sound like a utopian dream.
As a beginner I didnâ€™t know what to think. Few years later, despite to feel like always a beginner, 
Iâ€™d like to give you a gentle introduction of TDD with Python and how to do unit tests and how to refactor safely.
Unit tests and TDD?
Probably there are million of blog posts about this subject. But letâ€™s talk just a bit about it on my point of view! ðŸ˜…
Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.
But Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think (and write!) tests first.

Let me explain it better â€” with an example (finally the code!).
The freela
Imagine that a client has a website and through it he receives a lot of contacts from potential customers. 
After a while he realized that it is important for the business to identify the profile of consumer: age, gender, job and so on.
But the website just receive the name and the email.
They hired you to identify the gender of a person based on his/her name. Luckily, 
there is an amazing API called Genderize.io that identifies the possible genders. 
And you quickly developed your API connection:
requests.get('https://api.genderize.io/?name=ana')
However the client demands you to write unit tests and you are curious about TDD. 
Here our journey begins!
