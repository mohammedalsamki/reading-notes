## From the Duckett HTML book:

 ### Summary LISTS
 
* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, 
unordered, and definition. 
* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another

###Summary LISTS, TABLES AND FORMS

* In addition to the CSS properties covered in other 
chapters which work with the contents of all elements, 
there are several others that are specifically used to 
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
* List markers can be given different appearances 
using the list-style-type and list-style image 
properties.
* Table cells can have different borders and spacing in 
different browsers, but there are properties you can 
use to control them and make them more consistent. 
* Forms are easier to use if the form controls are 
vertically aligned using CSS.
* Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more 
interactive.
