## What is CSS for?
As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.

## How To Add CSS
When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.

Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS
